  Introduction
</h2>
<p align="center">
  Welcome to the AE Project. This project is created for educational purposes only.</br >
</p>

## Features

- Next.js app router with TypeScript for easier adaptation and faster learning for beginners.
- Minimal design to keep the application lightweight.
- Since I‚Äôm working solo on this project, implementing new features takes some time.

## Where Used What (Libraries):

- **Next.js**:

  - The entire application is wrapped with Next.js (using the `app/` router) and TypeScript.
  - **Why use Next.js instead of Vite-ReactJS or CRA (Create React App)?**: While Vite and CRA are great choices, I chose Next.js for its built-in features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). Another key reason is to leverage `next-auth` for authentication and its seamless integration with React.

## For local development

- Clone the repository.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Zeddxx/ani-fire.git
  ```

- Install the npm or yarn or pnpm.

  ```bash
  npm install or yarn add or pnpm install
  ```

- Add the `.env` on root directory.
  > [!TIP]
  > path: root to anifire outside the app directory

```bash
## This should be a aniwatch api of ritesh repo (without last slash /)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_ANIME_URL=E.G -> base_url/api/v2/hianime
```
